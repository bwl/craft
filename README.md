## Installation

### Option 1: Add to Your Project (Recommended)
```bash
# If using UV (recommended)
uv add craft-cli

# If using pip
pip install craft-cli
```

### Option 2: Install as Global Tool
```bash
# Install globally with UV
uv tool install craft-cli

# Then use anywhere
craft --help
```

### Option 3: Install from GitHub (Latest)
```bash
# For the bleeding edge
uv add git+https://github.com/bwl/craft.git

# Or with pip
pip install git+https://github.com/bwl/craft.git
```

### Quick Test
```bash
# Verify installation
craft --version

# See what's available
craft --domains

# Try the human-friendly interface
craft --help --noob
```

### What Actually Happens

**Example 1: Deploy a Writing Assistant**
```bash
$ craft slate namer character --type=protagonist --culture=nordic
```
→ *Smart agent generates 5 culturally appropriate Nordic protagonist names with context and meaning*

**Example 2: Fire Up a Code Quality Expert**
```bash
$ craft linting ruff check --fix src/
```
→ *Linting specialist scans your code, finds 23 issues, automatically fixes 19 of them, reports the 4 that need manual attention*

**Example 3: Summon a Test Engineer**
```bash
$ craft coding test --coverage
```
→ *Testing expert runs your full test suite, generates coverage report, identifies untested code paths*

### How AI Agents Discover and Use Tools

When Claude (or any AI agent) needs to accomplish something, they can:

1. **Explore domains**: `./craft --domains` shows all available specialist areas
2. **Scope by domain**: `./craft linting` lists only code quality tools  
3. **Get help**: `./craft linting ruff --help` explains exactly what each tool does
4. **Execute with confidence**: `./craft linting ruff check --fix` - the system takes over from there

The AI agent just runs `./craft` and the framework handles discovery, validation, and execution. No complex tool management needed.

### How Tools Are Configured

Each tool is defined by a simple YAML file that tells the system:

**Example: `domains/linting/tools/ruff.yaml`**
```yaml
name: "RUFF"
description: "Fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust"
command: "uv run ruff check {args}"
help: |
  Usage: craft linting ruff [options] [path]
  
  Options:
    --fix          Automatically fix violations
    --watch        Run in watch mode
    
  Examples:
    craft linting ruff check --fix src/
    craft linting ruff check . --watch
```

**What this means:**
- `name` & `description`: What the AI agent sees when exploring tools
- `command`: The actual command that gets executed (with argument substitution)
- `help`: Context-aware help that explains usage and provides examples

The framework handles all the plumbing - argument passing, error handling, output formatting. You just define what the specialist should do.

> ⚠️ **Friendly Disclaimer**: Most of the features promised below exist but some um... we will get back to you soon, dw 😅

## Fire Up Specialized Agents for Any Task

**Transform any specialized workflow into intelligent, agent-ready commands.**

Stop context-switching between tools. Stop explaining your domain knowledge over and over. **Craft CLI lets you deploy domain experts instantly** - whether that's a coding specialist, a linting expert, or a creative writing assistant.

Every `craft` command is really saying: *"Hey, someone smart who understands this domain - handle this for me."*

## The Problem

Domain-specific tools often have great functionality but poor adoption because they:
- Feel like "extra steps" outside normal workflow  
- Are easy to forget when focused on other tasks
- Lack integration with existing command-line habits
- Don't provide immediate feedback and guidance

## The Solution

Craft CLI makes domain tools feel like system commands (`git`, `npm`, `docker`) by providing:

- **Natural CLI integration** - `craft linting ruff check --fix`
- **Rich feedback** - Beautiful tables and panels using Rich library
- **Contextual help** - `craft linting ruff --help` shows tool-specific guidance
- **Tool discovery** - `craft linting` lists all available tools in domain
- **AI-optimized output** - Clean, parseable default output for agents
- **Human-friendly mode** - `--noob` flag for Rich UI when humans need it

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
uv tool install craft-cli

# Or with pip
pip install craft-cli
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Show help
craft --help

# List available domains  
craft --domains

# List tools in a domain
craft linting

# Run a tool
craft linting ruff check --fix

# Get tool-specific help

# Use human-friendly Rich UI
craft linting --noob
```

## Built-in Domains

### 🎯 Linting - Deploy a Code Quality Expert
```bash
craft linting ruff check --fix        # "Fix all the issues you find"
craft linting black .                 # "Format this code properly"
craft linting mypy src/               # "Check types thoroughly"
```

### 🛠️ Coding - Fire Up a Development Specialist  
```bash
craft coding test --coverage          # "Run comprehensive tests"

## Configuration System

Craft CLI includes built-in domains and supports custom domain paths via configuration files.

### Built-in Domains

Craft CLI comes with these domains out of the box:
- **linting**: Python code quality tools (ruff, black, mypy)
- **coding**: Development tools (test, build, git)
- **slate**: Novel writing tools (embark, namer)

### Custom Domain Configuration

Create `.craftrc` files to add your own domain paths:

**Project-level** (`./.craftrc`):
```yaml
domain_paths:
  - "./my-project-tools"
  - "./scripts/craft-domains"

config:
  default_human_mode: true
```

**User-level** (`~/.config/craft/craftrc`):
```yaml
domain_paths:
  - "~/my-craft-domains"
  - "/opt/shared-craft-tools"

include_builtin_domains: true  # Default: true
```

### Creating Custom Domains

### 1. Create Domain Structure
```bash
mkdir -p ~/my-craft-domains/mytools
```

### 2. Add Tools
```yaml
# ~/my-craft-domains/mytools/mytool.yaml
name: "MYTOOL"
description: "What my tool does"
command: "python mytool.py {args}"
category: "utilities"
help: |
  Usage: craft mytools mytool [options]
  Examples:
    craft mytools mytool --option=value
```

### 3. Use Your Domain
```bash
craft mytools                    # List your tools
craft mytools mytool --help      # Tool help
craft mytools mytool --verbose   # Run your tool
```

### Domain Precedence

When domains have the same name:
1. **Project-level** domains (from `./.craftrc`)
2. **User-level** domains (from `~/.config/craft/craftrc`)  
3. **Built-in** domains (from package)

### First-Time Setup

On first run, Craft CLI will offer to create an example config:
```bash
🚀 Welcome to Craft CLI!
No configuration found. Would you like to create an example config?
This will create ~/.config/craft/craftrc with sensible defaults.
Create example config? (y/N): 
```

## Architecture

### Built-in Domain Structure
```
craft-cli package includes:
src/craft_cli/domains/
├── linting/
│   ├── ruff.yaml
│   ├── black.yaml
│   └── mypy.yaml
├── coding/
│   ├── test.yaml
│   ├── build.yaml
│   └── git.yaml
└── slate/
    ├── embark.yaml
    └── namer.yaml
```

### Custom Domain Structure
```
User domains can be anywhere:
~/my-craft-domains/
├── mytools/
│   ├── tool1.yaml
│   └── tool2.yaml
└── devops/
    ├── deploy.yaml
    └── monitor.yaml
```

### Tool Definition Format
```yaml
name: "TOOL-NAME"
description: "Brief description"
command: "actual-command {args}"
category: "tool_category"
help: |
  Detailed help text with usage examples
```

## Advanced Usage

### Environment Integration
Craft CLI automatically finds domains from:
1. **Built-in domains** (included with package)
2. **Project-level config** (`./.craftrc` in current directory)
3. **User-level config** (`~/.config/craft/craftrc`)

Domain paths are merged with project-level taking precedence over user-level over built-in.

### Command Patterns
```bash
craft <domain>                    # List domain tools
craft <domain> <tool> [args]      # Run tool with arguments
craft <domain> <tool> --help      # Tool-specific help
craft --domains                   # List all domains
craft --help [--noob]            # Framework help
craft --version                   # Show version
```

### Flags
- `--noob` - Enable Rich UI (tables, panels, colors)
- `--verbose` - Show command being executed
- `--help` - Context-sensitive help
